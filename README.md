# Bayesian model fitting with emcee
*Giuliano Antoniciello*

The [** *emcee* **](http://dfm.io/emcee/current/) MCMC sampler is a powerful tool to perform complex and computationally daunting Bayesian inference.

We will review the fundamentals of Bayesian probability theory and apply them to some model fitting examples in Astronomy. The needed Python libraries are:

1.  [*emcee*](http://dfm.io/emcee/current/) to run the MCMC simulations;
2.  [*corner*](https://corner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to show the results.
